# Dan's Phase 2 Final Project

## Overview

This app allows you to view a list of shoes, sort that list by a few key name-brands, and even add a shoe using the "Add a Shoe" form. 

## Requirements to use the app

This app uses a json file to simulate communication with a server. In order to use the simulator, you'll need to have json-server installed on your local machine. If you do not have json-server installed, you can find instructions on how to do so here: [Link] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

You'll also need to install react router. You can find information on how to do so here: [Link] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)

Then, you'll need to open a terminal and run 'npm run server' which will open the db.json file in your browser. Be sure to add '/shoes' to the end of the URL to see the contents of the file in your browser. 

Open a new terminal and run 'npm start' to open the app in your browser. From there, you can start interacting with the app.
